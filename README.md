## About the Business

Rugby Barnacle is a LGBTQ+ business that sells custom and premade handcrafted tufted rugs.
Custom orders are made to order while premade rugs can be bought as long as stock is available.
It started in the small home of Emilie Cruz, during 2023. While wondering what to do she decided to begin the hobby of tufting handcrafted rugs.
She now makes a variety of tufted products from coasters, mirrors, bath rugs, wall rugs, and more.

**For the remainder of this markdown, Rugly Barnacle will be referred to as RB**
